# Student cellular automata project
This project was about creating an application that will use cellular automata in grain (crystallites) growth problems in material science.
It's written in Java using Swing Library. The logic in the App is held via Arrays and Arrays List.
The drawings during simulation are populated by the paint() method on Canvas Component based on Model Output Array.
The simulation redraws the updated output Array. The results can be exported in two formats, the import also works for both. 
This was my first student project, now I would not rather choose Arrays to populate the simulation. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¥° 
But after all, I'm happy with the output I got, and I had lots of fun implementing it.
